Data Definition Language (DDL) is a subset of SQL that is used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and procedures. They are also used to grant and revoke privileges to users.

DDL statements are permanent and irrevocable, meaning that they make changes to the underlying database structure. This makes them different from Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements, which are used to manipulate the data within a database and are typically temporary.
