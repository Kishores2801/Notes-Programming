The `DROP TABLE` statement in SQL is used to delete an existing table from a database. It is an irreversible operation, so it should be used with caution.

The syntax for the `DROP TABLE` statement is as follows:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Where:

- `table_name`Â is the name of the table you want to delete.

Here is an example of how to delete a table called `customers`:

```sql
DROP TABLE customers;
```

This statement will delete the `customers` table from the database. All data in the table will be lost.
