Built-in functions in SQL are predefined functions that perform specific operations on data. They provide a convenient and efficient way to manipulate and analyze data within SQL queries. Built-in functions are categorized based on their functionality, such as string functions, numeric functions, date and time functions, and aggregate functions.

- Most of the databases comes with built-in SQL Functions.
- Built-in Functions can be included as a part of SQL Statements
- Database Functions can significantly reduce the amount of data that need to be retrieved.
- Can Speed up data processing.

**String Functions:**

String functions manipulate and transform string data. They are commonly used for tasks like formatting, extracting substrings, comparing strings, and converting data types.

Examples:

- `LENGTH(string)`: Returns the length of a string.
- `SUBSTRING(string, start, length)`: Extracts a substring from a string.
- `UPPER(string)`: Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.
- `LOWER(string)`: Converts all characters in a string to lowercase.
- `TRIM(string)`: Removes leading and trailing spaces from a string.

**Numeric Functions:**

Numeric functions perform operations on numeric data. They are used for calculations, conversions, and mathematical operations.

Examples:

- `ABS(number)`: Returns the absolute value of a number.
- `SQRT(number)`: Calculates the square root of a number.
- `POW(number, power)`: Raises a number to a specified power.
- `ROUND(number, decimals)`: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
- `CEILING(number)`: Rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- `FLOOR(number)`: Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

**Date and Time Functions:**

Date and time functions manipulate and extract information from date and time data. They are used for tasks like formatting dates, extracting date components, and performing date calculations.

Examples:

- `CURRENT_DATE`: Returns the current date.
- `CURRENT_TIME`: Returns the current time.
- `YEAR(date)`: Extracts the year from a date.
- `MONTH(date)`: Extracts the month from a date.
- `DAY(date)`: Extracts the day from a date.
- `HOUR(time)`: Extracts the hour from a time.
- `MINUTE(time)`: Extracts the minute from a time.
- `SECOND(time)`: Extracts the second from a time.
- `DATEDIFF(date1, date2)`: Calculates the difference between two dates.

**Aggregate Functions:**

Aggregate functions summarize data over groups of rows. They are used to calculate values like sums, averages, counts, minimums, and maximums.

Examples:

- `SUM(column)`: Calculates the sum of values in a column.
- `AVG(column)`: Calculates the average of values in a column.
- `COUNT(column)`: Counts the number of values in a column.
- `MIN(column)`: Finds the minimum value in a column.
- `MAX(column)`: Finds the maximum value in a column.

Built-in functions are essential tools for data manipulation and analysis in SQL. They provide a wide range of functionalities for working with different data types and performing common operations, making SQL a powerful and versatile language for data management.
