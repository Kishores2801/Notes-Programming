**TRUNCATE TABLE** statement is used to remove all rows from a table, including all associated data from indexes, triggers, and other dependent objects. It is an irreversible operation, so it should be used with caution.

The syntax for the **TRUNCATE TABLE** statement is as follows:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name
IMMEDIATE;
```
Where:

- `table_name` is the name of the table you want to truncate.

The **TRUNCATE TABLE** statement is similar to the **DELETE** statement, but it has several important differences:

- **The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement does not require a WHERE clause.** This means that all rows in the table will be deleted, even if they have not been modified since the last backup.
- **The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement does not send any triggers.** This means that any triggers that are defined on the table will not be executed when the table is truncated.

**Here is an example of how to truncate the `customers` table:**

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE customers
IMMEDIATE;
```

This statement will remove all rows from the `customers` table. This will also remove all associated data from indexes, triggers, and other dependent objects.

The **TRUNCATE TABLE** statement is a useful tool for quickly removing all data from a table. However, it should be used with caution, as it is an irreversible operation. It is always a good idea to back up the data in a table before truncating it.
