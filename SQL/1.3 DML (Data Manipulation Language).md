Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL that is used to manipulate data within a database. DML statements are used to **insert** new data into tables, **update** existing data, **delete** data from tables, and **retrieve** data from one or more tables.

DML statements are **temporary** and can be rolled back, meaning that they do not make permanent changes to the database. This makes them different from Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, which are used to define and manage the structure of a database and are typically permanent.

### Common DML Statement
