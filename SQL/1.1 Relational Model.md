- Relational model are most used data model.
- Relational model allows for data independence.
- Data is stored in a tables.

#### Entity-Relationship Model
- Used as a tool to design ==relationship== databases.
- Mapping a Entity-Relationship Model
	- Entities becomes tables.
	- Attributes are changed to column.
	
 Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are visual representations of data and their relationships. They are used to model the structure of databases and can help to ensure data integrity and consistency.

An ERD is typically made up of three main components:

-  **Entities**: These are the basic building blocks of an ERD and represent the objects or concepts that are being stored in the database. For example, in a school database, entities could include students, teachers, and courses.
-  **Attributes**: These are the properties or characteristics of an entity. For example, a student entity could have attributes such as name, ID number, and major.
- **Relationships**: These show how entities are related to each other. For example, a student could be enrolled in one or more courses, and a course could have one or more students enrolled in it. 

 **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys** are two important types of constraints that are used in ERDs.
- **Primary key**
	 *A primary key is a unique identifier for an entity. It is a single attribute or a combination of attributes that can be used to distinguish one instance of an entity from any other instance of the same entity. 
	 
	 For example, a student's ID number could be a primary key for the student entity.*
	 
- **Foreign key**
	 *A foreign key is a column in one table that references the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between the two tables. 
	 
	 For example, the course_id attribute in the student_enrollments table could be a foreign key that references the primary key of the courses table.

#### Basic ERD Symbols

- **Rectangle**
	 Represent entities, which are the basic building blocks of a database. Each entity has attributes that describe it.
- **Diamonds**
	 Represent relationships between entities. The type of relationship is indicated by the cardinality and participation of the entities.
- **Lines**
     Connect entities and relationships. The cardinality of a relationship indicates the number of times one entity can be associated with another.

#### Cardinality
-  **One-to-one (1:1)**
	 An entity can be associated with one and only one instance of another entity.
-  **One-to-many (1:N)**
	 An entity can be associated with zero, one, or many instances of another entity.
-  **Many-to-many (M:N)**
	 An entity can be associated with zero or more instances of another entity, and vice versa.

#### Participation
Consider a library system that stores information about books, authors, and publishers. The following ERD depicts the relationships between these entities:
-  Each book has one author and one publisher.
-  Each author can write multiple books.
-  Each publisher publishes many books.

#### Benefits of ERDs
- **Improved understanding of data:** ERDs provide a clear and concise representation of data, making it easier to understand the structure of a database.
- **Reduced data redundancy:** By identifying relationships between entities, ERDs can help to reduce data redundancy, which can improve data integrity and efficiency.
- **Clearer documentation:** ERDs can serve as a valuable documentation tool for understanding and maintaining a database.

#### Creating ERDs
There are many different tools and methodologies available for creating ERDs. Some popular tools include
- **Lucidchart:** A cloud-based platform for creating diagrams, including ERDs.
- **[Draw.io](http://Draw.io):** A free and open-source tool for creating diagrams.
- **StarUML:** A cross-platform tool for creating software modeling diagrams, including ERDs.

#### Summary
ERDs are a powerful tool for modeling and designing databases. They can help to ensure data integrity, consistency, and efficiency.
