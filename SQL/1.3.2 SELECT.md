Retrieve Data from a database table. It specifies the columns to be extracted and may apply filtered conditions to narrow down the results.
``` SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE
```
**Retrieve all columns from a table.**
``` SQL
SELECT * FROM Book
```
**Retrieve only sub set of the columns**
``` SQL
SELECT [Columnname], [Columnname] FROM TABLE
```
Retrieve `Book_id`, `Title `from `book` table.
``` SQL
SELECT book_id, title 
FROM Book;
```
##### Retrieve rows based on condition
``` SQL
SELECT [Columnname], [Columnname] FROM TABLE 
WHERE Condition
```
Retrieve `Book_id`, `Title` from `book` table, if there `Book_id` is B1.
``` SQL
SELECT book_id, title 
FROM Book 
WHERE book_id='B1';
```
In SQL, you can use both `OR` and `IN` operators to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct applications.

`AND` **Operator:**
The `AND` operator in SQL is used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause, where all of the conditions must be true for the overall condition to be satisfied. It's used to narrow down the results and only retrieve records that meet all the specified criteria.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3;
```

**`OR` Operator:**
The `OR` operator combines multiple conditions, where any of the conditions being true will satisfy the overall condition. It's used to check for multiple possibilities or alternatives.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE age > 30 AND country = 'USA' AND gender = 'Male';
```

This query selects all customers from the `customers` table where the `age` is greater than 30, the `country` is 'USA', and the `gender` is 'Male'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA' OR country = 'Canada';
```
This query selects all customers from the `customers` table where the `country` is either 'USA' or 'Canada'.

**Combining `AND` with `OR`:**
You can combine `AND` and `OR` operators to create more complex conditions. When combining `AND` and `OR`, the `AND` operator takes precedence. Use parentheses to group conditions if necessary.
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE (age > 30 OR age < 20) AND country = 'USA';
```
This query selects all customers from the `customers` table where the `age` is either greater than 30 or less than 20, and the `country` is 'USA'.

**`IN` Operator:**

The `IN` operator checks whether a value is present within a specified set of values. It's used to compare a value against a list of options.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE ColumnName IN (condition1, condition2, condition3);
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE age IN (25, 30, 35);
```
This query selects all customers from the `customers` table where the `age` is 25, 30, or 35.

##### Retrieve rows based on Range
Retrieving rows based on range using between function.
```sql
*// Selecting all rows with column name within the range
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN lower_limit AND upper_limit
```
to retrieve all rows where the `age` column in the `customers` table is between 25 and 35.

##### Retrieve rows based on String Pattern
retrieving rows using a String Pattern
```sql
*// Selecting all rows with string pattern
SELECT * FROM TABLE
WHERE [Columnname] LIKE <string pattern>
```
Selecting all rows with string pattern starts with string name
```sql
*// Selecting all rows with string pattern starts with R
SELECT * FROM TABLE
WHERE [Columnname] LIKE R%
```
Selecting all rows with string pattern ends with string name
```sql
*// Selecting all rows with string pattern ends with R
SELECT * FROM TABLE
WHERE [Columnname] LIKE %R
```
Selecting all rows with string pattern has string name within String
```sql
*// Selecting all rows with R has string name within String
SELECT * FROM TABLE
WHERE [Columnname] LIKE %R%
```
### Sorting the result set
Sorting the result set in SQL is achieved using the `ORDER BY` clause. It allows you to arrange the retrieved data in a specific order based on the values of one or more columns.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC, column2 ASC/DESC, ...;
```
- `column1 ASC/DESC`: Specifies the first column to sort by, along with the sorting order (ascending or descending). Use `ASC` for ascending order (A to Z or smallest to largest) and `DESC` for descending order (Z to A or largest to smallest).
- `column2 ASC/DESC`: Optionally, specify additional columns to sort by, following the same pattern of column name and sorting order.
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY country ASC;
```
This query selects all customers from the `customers` table and sorts them in ascending order by `country`.

**Multiple Sorting Criteria:**
You can sort by multiple columns using the `ORDER BY` clause. The order of columns in the `ORDER BY` clause determines the precedence of sorting.
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY country ASC, age DESC, gender ASC;
```
This query sorts customers first by `country` (ascending), then by `age` (descending), and finally by `gender` (ascending).

**Sorting NULL Values:**
NULL values are treated differently when sorting in SQL. By default, NULL values are placed at the end of the sorted result set. However, you can explicitly specify the sorting order for NULL values using the `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST` keywords.
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY country ASC, age DESC NULLS FIRST;
```
This query sorts customers by `country` (ascending) and `age` (descending), placing NULL values for `age` at the beginning of the sorted result set.### Grouping Results sets
#### Grouping
Grouping result sets in SQL is achieved using the `GROUP BY` clause, which allows you to aggregate data based on specific columns. It categorizes rows based on common values in one or more columns and then performs aggregations on those groups.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

- `column1, column2`: Specifies the columns to group by.
- `aggregate_function`: Applies an aggregation function to the grouped data, such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, or `MAX`.

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM customers
GROUP BY country;
```

This query counts the number of customers from each country in the `customers` table.

**Grouping with Multiple Columns:**

You can group by multiple columns to create more granular groupings. The order of columns in the `GROUP BY` clause doesn't affect the grouping, but it does affect the order of the results.

```sql
SELECT country, gender, COUNT(*)
FROM customers
GROUP BY country, gender;
```

**Aggregate Functions:**

The `GROUP BY` clause is typically used in conjunction with aggregate functions to summarize data within each group. Common aggregate functions include:

- `COUNT`: Counts the number of rows in each group.
- `SUM`: Calculates the sum of values in each group.
- `AVG`: Calculates the average of values in each group.
- `MIN`: Finds the minimum value in each group.
- `MAX`: Finds the maximum value in each group.

**HAVING Clause:**

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter grouped data based on certain conditions. It applies conditions to the aggregated data after the grouping has taken place.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING aggregate_function(column3) > 100;
```
This query selects countries with more than 100 customers.

**Grouping with Subqueries:**

You can also use subqueries within the `SELECT` clause of a query that includes the `GROUP BY` clause. This allows for more complex aggregations and filtering based on data from other tables.

```sql
SELECT country, SUM(order_amount)
FROM orders
GROUP BY country
HAVING SUM(order_amount) > (SELECT AVG(order_amount) FROM orders);
```

This query selects countries with a total order amount greater than the average order amount.

Grouping result sets is a powerful tool for summarizing and analyzing data in SQL. It allows you to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within your data, providing valuable insights for decision-making and understanding.

### Distinct Clause

The `DISTINCT` clause in SQL is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set of a SELECT query. It ensures that only unique combinations of values are returned, preventing the same row from appearing multiple times.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

This query selects the distinct values of the `name` and `age` columns from the `customers` table.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, age
FROM customers;
```
