`SQL joins` are used to retrieve data from multiple tables. They allow you to relate tables based on common columns and fetch relevant information in a single query.

##### Types of SQL Joins
- **INNER JOIN**
- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**
- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**
- **CROSS JOIN**


##### Basic Syntax
The basic syntax for a join is:
```SQL
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN_TYPE table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```


###### INNER JOIN
Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
``` SQL
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

The `INNER JOIN` example retrieves the `id` and `first_name` from the `employees` table and the `name` of the department from the `departments` table where there is a matching `department_id` in both tables.

```SQL
SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, departments.name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

###### LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL from the right side.

``` SQL
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```
The `LEFT JOIN` example retrieves all employees and their departments, even if some employees are not assigned to any department (in which case the department name will be NULL).

``` SQl
SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, departments.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

###### RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, the result is NULL from the left side.

``` SQL
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

The `RIGHT JOIN` example retrieves all departments and their employees, even if some departments have no employees assigned (in which case the employee details will be NULL).

``` SQL
SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, departments.name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

###### FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. It returns NULL on the side where there is no match.
``` SQL
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

The `FULL JOIN` example retrieves all employees and their departments, showing all employees and all departments, with NULLs where there are no matches.

``` SQL
SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, departments.name
FROM employees
FULL JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

###### CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows.

``` SQl
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

The `CROSS JOIN` example retrieves a combination of every employee with every department, resulting in a Cartesian product.

```SQL
SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, departments.name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

######  SELF JOIN
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
``` SQL
SELECT a.column1, a.column2, b.column1, b.column2
FROM table_name a
JOIN table_name b
ON a.common_column = b.common_column;
```

The `SELF JOIN` example retrieves pairs of employees where one is the manager of the other. It treats the `employees` table as two different tables (A and B) to find the relationship.

``` SQL
SELECT A.id AS EmployeeID, A.first_name AS EmployeeName, B.id AS ManagerID, B.first_name AS ManagerName
FROM employees A, employees B
WHERE A.manager_id = B.id;
```


SQL joins are fundamental for querying data across multiple tables based on related columns. Understanding how each type of join works helps you fetch the required data efficiently.
