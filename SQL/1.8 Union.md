The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows between the various `SELECT` statements unless `UNION ALL` is used.

##### Types of SQL UNION
- `UNION`
- `UNION ALL`

 
###### Basic Syntax
The basic syntax for a `UNION` is:

``` SQL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

##### UNION
The `UNION` operator combines the results of two `SELECT` statements and removes duplicate rows.

**Example**
Suppose you have two tables, `employees` and `managers`, and you want to list all distinct names from both tables:

**employees**

| **Id** | **Name**      |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 1      | John Doe      |
| 2      | Jane Smith    |
| 3      | Alice Johnson |
**managers**

| **Id** | **Name**   |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1      | Jane Smith |
| 2      | Bob Brown  |

``` SQL
SELECT name
FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name
FROM managers;
```

**Result**

| Name          |
| ------------- |
| John Doe      |
| Jane Smith    |
| Alice Johnson |
| Bob Brown     |
In this result, "Jane Smith" appears only once because `UNION` removes duplicates.

##### UNION ALL
The `UNION ALL` operator combines the results of two `SELECT` statements and includes duplicate rows.

 **Example**

Using the same `employees` and `managers` tables, if you want to include all names, even if they are duplicates:

``` sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT name
FROM managers;
```

| Name          |
| ------------- |
| John Doe      |
| Jane Smith    |
| Alice Johnson |
| Jane Smith    |
| Bob Brown     |
In this result, "Jane Smith" appears twice because `UNION ALL` includes duplicates.

##### Key Points

- **Column Matching**: The `SELECT` statements within a `UNION` must have the same number of columns, and the corresponding columns must have compatible data types.
- **Order of Results**: If you want to sort the results, you can use `ORDER BY` at the end of the combined query. Note that `ORDER BY` can only be used once, at the end of the last `SELECT` statement.
##### Example with ORDER BY

``` sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name
FROM managers
ORDER BY name;
```

- **`UNION`**: Combines results from multiple `SELECT` statements, removing duplicates.
- **`UNION ALL`**: Combines results from multiple `SELECT` statements, including duplicates.

Both `UNION` and `UNION ALL` are useful for merging results from different tables or queries, with the key difference being whether duplicates should be removed or not.
