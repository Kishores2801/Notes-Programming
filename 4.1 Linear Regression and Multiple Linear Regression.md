##### Linear Regression
- **Concept:** A statistical method for modeling the linear relationship between a dependent variable (y) and a single independent variable (x).
- **Goal:** To find the best-fitting straight line (regression line) through the data points that represents this relationship.
- **Equation:** y = `β0 + β1x + ε`
    - `β0`: Intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)
    - `β1`: Slope (how much y changes for a unit change in x)
    - `ε`: Error term (representing random variation in the data)
