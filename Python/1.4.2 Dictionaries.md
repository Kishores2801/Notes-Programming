**Collections**

- A collection is nice because we can put more than one value in it and carry them all around in one convenient package.
- We have a bunch of values in a single “variable”.
- We do this by having more than one place “in” the variable.
- We have ways of finding the different places in the variables.
- Dictionaries are python’s most powerful data collection.
- Dictionaries allow us to do fast database-like operations in python
- List index their entries based on positions in the list but dictionaries are like bags no order.
- So we index the things we put in the dictionary with a lookup tag

```python
# Dictionary
purse = dict()

purse['money'] = 12
purse['Candy'] = 3
purse['tissues'] = 75

purse

**output:**
--------
****{'money': 12, 'Candy': 3, 'tissues': 75}
```

##### Common Application of Dictionaries

one common use of dictionaries is counting how often we “see” something,

```python
# counting the occurence
ccc = dict()
ccc['csev'] = 1
ccc['csew'] = 1
print(ccc)

**output:**
--------
{'csev': 1, 'csew': 1}

ccc['csew'] = ccc['csew'] + 1
print(ccc)

**output:**
--------
{'csev': 1, 'csew': 2}
```

```python
# counting the occurence based on loop
count = dict()

names = ['csev', 
        'cwen',
        'csev', 
        'zqian',
        'cwen']

# for loop
for name in names:
    if name not in count:
        count[name]=1
    else:
         count[name]=count[name] + 1
count

**output:**
--------
{'csev': 2, 'cwen': 2, 'zqian': 1}
```

##### Get Method

The Pattern of checking to see if a key is already in a dictionary and assuming a default value if the key is not there if so common that there is a method called get().

```python
if name in counts:
	x = count[name]
else:
	x = 0

x = count.get(name,0)

```

##### Retrieving list of keys and values
you can get a list of keys, values or items (both) from a dictionary.

```python
# dictionary
jjj = {'chuck':1 , "fred": 24, "jen":100}

# will give only keys
print(list(jjj))

**output:**
--------
['chuck', 'fred', 'jen']

# will give only keys
print(jjj.keys())

**output:**
--------
['chuck', 'fred', 'jen']

# will give only values for each keys
print(jjj.values())

**output:**
--------
dict_values([1, 24, 100])

# will give keys and values for keys as tuple
print(jjj.items())

**output:**
--------
dict_items([('chuck', 1), ('fred', 24), ('jen', 100)])
```

##### Two iteration Variables

- we Loop through the key-value pairs in a dictionary using _two_ iteration variable.
- Each iteration, the first variable is the key and second variable is the corresponding value for the key,

```python
jjj = {'chuck':1 , "fred": 24, "jen":100}

for aaa, bbb in jjj.items():
		print(aaa,bbb)

**output:**
--------
chuck 1
fred 24
jen 100
```

##### Dictionaries and Loops

**Definite Loops and Dictionaries**
Even though dictionaries are not stored in order, we can write a for loop that goes through all the entries in a dictionary - actually it goes through all of the keys in the dictionary and looks up the values.

```python
# Dictionary
counts  = {"chuck": 1, "Fred":42, "Jan":100}

for key in counts:
	print(key, counts[key])

**output:**
--------
chuck 1
Fred 42
Jan 100
```
