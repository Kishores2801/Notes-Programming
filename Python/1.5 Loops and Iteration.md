Loops is a repeated steps have **iteration variables** that change each time through a loop. Often these **Iteration variables** go through a sequence of numbers.

#### Infinite Loop

- While loops are called “indefinite loop” because they keep going until a logical condition become “False”.
- The Loops we have seen so far are pretty easy to examine to see if they will terminate or if they will be “indefinite Loop”.
- Sometimes it is a little harder to be sure if a loop while terminate.

```python
n=0
While True:
	n=1+n
	print(n)
```

##### Breaking out of Loop

- The “Break” statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement immediately following the loop.
- It is like a loop test that can happen anywhere the body of the loop.

```python
# infinite loop with break statement
while True:
    line = input("> ")
    if line == "done":
        break
    print(line)
print("Done!")

**Output**:
---------
> help1
help1
> done
done!
```

##### Finishing an iteration with continue

The “Continue” statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the tops of the loop and starts the next iteration.

```python
## Continue iteration
while True:
    line = input("> ")
    if line[0] == "#":
        continue
    if line =="done":
        break
    print (line)
print ("Done!")

**Output**:
---------
> help1
help1
> done
done!
```

#### Definite Loops

Definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables that change each time through a loop. These iteration variables move through through the sequence or set.

- Quite often we have a “list” of items of the lines in a file - effectively a “finite set” of things.
- we can write a loop to run the loop once for each of the items in a set using the python “for” construct.
- These loops are called “definite loops” because they execute an exact number of times.
- We say that “definite loops iterate through the members of a set”.

```python
# Definite loop
for i in [5,4,3,2,1]:
	print(i)
print("Blastoff!")

**Output**:
---------
5
4
3
2
1
Blastoff!
```

#### Iterations: Loop Idioms

The trick is “knowing” something about the whole loop when you are stuck writing code that only sees one entry at a time.

```python
# loops
print("Before!")
for thing in [9,41,12,3,74,15]:
    print(thing)
print("After")

**Output**:
---------
Before!
9
41
12
3
74
15
After
```

```python
# return the largest number
largest_so_far = -1
print("before:", largest_so_far)
for i in [10,20,1,23,4,5,6,78,888,8,1111,20,203,1234]:
    if i > largest_so_far:
        largest_so_far=i
    print("after:", largest_so_far)

print("after:", largest_so_far)

**Output**:
---------
before: -1
after: 10
after: 20
after: 20
after: 23
after: 23
after: 23
after: 23
after: 78
after: 888
after: 888
after: 1111
after: 1111
after: 1111
after: 1234
after: 1234
```

#### Iteration: More Patterns
**Counting in a Loop**

To “count” how many times we execute a loop, we introduce a counter variable that start at 0 and we add one to it each time through the loop.

```python
# counting the iteration loop
count = 0
print("before",count)

for num in range(1,10):
    count = count+1
    print(count," : ",num)
print("after",count)

**Output**:
---------
before 0
1  :  1
2  :  2
3  :  3
4  :  4
5  :  5
6  :  6
7  :  7
8  :  8
9  :  9
10  :  10
before 10
```

#### Filtering in a Loop
we use an if statement in the loop to catch / filter the value we are looking for.

```python
print("before")
for value in [9,12,3,44,50,53,33,199]:
    if value>20:
        print("Greater than 20: ",value)
print("After")

**Output**:
---------
before
Greater than 20:  44
Greater than 20:  50
Greater than 20:  53
Greater than 20:  33
Greater than 20:  199
After
```

#### Search using a Boolean Variable
If we just want to search and know if a value was found, we use a variable that start at False and is set to True as soon as we find what we are looking for.

```python
# Search using a Boolean Variable
found = False
print("Before:", found)
for value in [9,31,22,44,22,74,15]:
    if value == 3:
        found = True
    print(found, value)
print("After", found)

**Output**:
---------
Before: False
False 9
False 31
False 22
False 44
True 3
True 22
True 74
True 15
After True
```

#### The “is” and “is not” operators

- Python has an is Operators that can be used in logical expressions
- Implies “is the same as”
- Similar to, but stronger than ==
- is not also is a operator

```python
# Determine the smallest values
Smallest = None
# Printing value
print("Before")

for value in [2,3,45,6,7,21,22,33,23,1,34,-1,-199,4,44,44,4444]:
    if Smallest is None:
        Smallest = value
    elif value < Smallest:
        Smallest = value
    print(Smallest,value)
print("After", Smallest)

**Output**:
---------
Before
2 2
2 3
2 45
2 6
2 7
2 21
2 22
2 33
2 23
1 1
1 34
-1 -1
-199 -199
-199 4
-199 44
-199 44
-199 4444
After -199
```
