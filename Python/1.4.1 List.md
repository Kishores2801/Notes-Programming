Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Square brackets are used.
- Lists are mutable.
- Lists can contain any type of data together.
- Indexing is starting from 0.
- Lists allow negative indexing.
- Several functions are available for operations in lists.

<aside> ðŸ’¡ e.g: [2,"Light",34,22,2,["2",3,2,"44"]] â‡’ These types of list are known as nested list which can include other combined data types.

### List Indexing

Python's indexing starts from 0 where first element start with 0. we can also do negative indexing where the index of last element start with -1.
![[List Indexing.png]]

```python
a = [1,3,4,5,6,7,8]

# Indexing for list start from 0,this will provide first element in list
a[0] = 0

# Indexing for list start from -1,this will provide last element in list
a[-1] = 8
```

### List Slicing
Consider a python list, In-order to access a range of elements in a list, you need to slice a list. One way to do this is to use the simple slicing operator i.e. colon(:)

![[List Slicing.png]]

```python
# List 
a = [1,3,4,5,6,7,8]

# From the 3rd element and slice upto last element.
a[2:] = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# From the 3rd element and slice upto 5th element.
a[2:4] = [4, 5]
```

#### List Functions

#### Base Functions

**Length Function**

To show the length of the list

```python
# List
a = [3,4,5,6,7,8]
b = [1,2,3,4,5]

# The length of the List
len(a) = 6
len(b) = 5
```

**Sum Function**

Total sum of list only applies for integer float list.

```python
# List
a = [3,4,5,6,7,8]

# The sum of the list elements.
sum(a) = 33
```

**Min Function**

Minimum values of list only applies for integer float list. Return the Minimum Value in the list.

```python
# List
a = [3,4,5,6,7,8]

# show the minimum value in list
min(a) = 3
```

**Max Function**

Maximum values of list only applies for integer float list. Return the Maximum Value in the list.

```python
# List
a = [3,4,5,6,7,8]

# show the minimum value in list
min(a) = 8
```

**List Functions** These are the functions that are only applicable for List values.

| Method    | Description                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| append()  | Adds an element at the end of the list                                      |
| clear()   | Removes all the elements from the list                                      |
| copy()    | Returns a copy of the list                                                  |
| extend()  | Returns the number of elements with the specified value                     |
| index()   | Identifying the index for the element in list,                              |
| insert()  | Add the elements of a list (or any iterate), to the end of the current list |
| pop()     | Adds an element at the specified position                                   |
| remove()  | Removes the first item with the specified value                             |
| reverse() | Reverses the order of the list                                              |
| sort()    | Sorts the list                                                              |

**.append()**

Adds an element at the end of the list.

```python
# List
L = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0]

# Adding one element to the list as the last element
L.append(100)
L => [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 100]
```

**.extend()**

Adding multiple element to the list at last.

```python
# List
L = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0]

# Adding Multiple elements at last
L.extend([10,20,30])
L => [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,20,30]
```

**.insert()**

Adding a value in specific position of the list. in the syntax first specify the position and then the value to be included in that position.

```python
# List
L = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0]

# Adding a value in between elements
L.insert(2,1203)
L => [1, 2, 1203, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]
```

**.remove()**

Removing the elements from list. only removes the first occurrence from list.

```python
# List
L = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0]

# Removing an element from list
L.remove(2)
L => [1,3,5,6,7,8,9,0]
```

**.Sort()**

Arranging the list to ascending order.

```python
# List
L = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0]

# Arranging the list to Ascending order
L.sort()
L => [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9]
```

Arranging the list to descending order.

```python
# List
L = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0]

# Arranging the list to Descending order
L.sort(reverse=True)
L => [9,8,7,6,5,3,2,1,0]
```

**.Count()**

Counting the specific Elements is in list.

```python
# List
L = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0,0,1,2,3,4,5]

# Counting the specific elements is in List
L.count(0) => 2
```

**.index()**

Identifying the index for the element in list. This will only return the index value for the first occurrence.

```python
# List
L = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,0]

# Idenitfying the index for the element in list
L.index(2) => 1
```
