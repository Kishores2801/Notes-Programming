In computing, a regular expression, also referred to as “regex” or “regexp”, provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular character, words or patterns of characters. A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor.

#### Understanding Regular Expressions

- Very powerful and quite cryptic.
- Fun once you understand them.
- Regular Expressions are a language unto themselves
- A language of “Marker Characters”- programming with Characters.
- It is kind of an “old school” Language - compact.

Here's a table that provides a quick reference for some common regular expression patterns used in programming:

|Pattern|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|^|Start of a string|/^abc/|
|$|End of a string|/xyz$/|
|.|Any character except newline|/a.b/|
|\d|Any digit|/\d+/|
|\w|Any word character (alphanumeric and underscore)|/\w+/|
|\s|Any whitespace character|/\s+/|
|[abc]|Any character within the brackets|/[aeiou]/|
|[^abc]|Any character not within the brackets|/[^0-9]/|
|*|Zero or more occurrences|/ab*c/|
|+|One or more occurrences|/ab+c/|
|?|Zero or one occurrence|/colou?r/|
|{n}|Exactly n occurrences|/a{3}/|
|{n,}|n or more occurrences|/a{2,}/|
|{n,m}|Between n and m occurrences|/a{1,3}/|
|(pattern)|Grouping|/(abc)+/|
|||Alternation (OR)|
|\b|Word boundary|/\btest\b/|
|(?i)|Case-insensitive mode|/hello(?i)world/|
|(?m)|Multi-line mode|/^abc$/m|
|(?:pattern)|Non-capturing group|/(?:ab)+/|
|(?=pattern)|Positive lookahead|/\d+(?=%)/|
|(?!pattern)|Negative lookahead|/\d+(?!%)/|

This table provides a brief overview of some commonly used regex patterns. Remember to consult the documentation of your programming language or library for the specific syntax and functionalities available for regular expressions.

### The Regular Expression Module

- Before you can use regular expressions in your program, you must import the library using **import re**.
- You can use **re.search()** to see if a string matches a regular expression, similar to using the find() method for strings.
- You can use **re.findall()** to extract portion of strings that match your regular expression, similar to a combination of **find()** and slicing **var[5:10]**.

#### Wild-Card Characters

- The dot Character matches any Character.
- If you add the **asterisk** character, the Character is anu number of times.

#### Regular Expressions: Matching and Extracting Data

##### Matching and Extracting Data

- **re.search()** return a True/False depending on whether the string matches the regular expression.
    
- if we actually want the matching string to be extracted we use **re.findall()**
    
    ```python
    import re
    
    x = 'My 2 favourite number are 19 and 42'
    y = re.findall('[0-9]+',x)
    print(y)
    ```

#### Warning: Greedy Matching

The repeat character (* and +) push outward in both directions (greedy) to match the largest possible string.

```python
import re

x = 'From: using the: Character'
y = re.findall('^F.+:'  x)
print(y)

**Output:**
-----------------
['From: using the:']
```

### Non-Greedy Matching

- Not all regular expression repeat codes are greedy!, If you add a ? character, the + and * chill out a bit.
    
    ```python
    import re
    
    x = 'From: using the: Character'
    y = re.findall('^F.+?:'  x)
    print(y)
    
    **Output:**
    ----------- 
    ****['From:']
    
    ```
    

### Fine Tuning String Extractions

- If we want to extract a specific portion of the matched substring, we can use parentheses to group the desired part and then use **re.findall()** to extract only that part.
    
``` Python
import re
    
x = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('^From .*@([^ ]*)', x)
print(y)

```
    
``` Python
import re

x = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('^From .*@([^ ]*)', x)
print(y)
```

> [!NOTE]
>     This code will extract only the domain name of the email address.

- We can also use escape characters to match special characters in the text, such as backslashes, dollar signs, and parentheses.
``` Python
import re

x = 'We received $10.00 for cookies.'
y = re.findall('\\\\$[0-9.]+', x)
print(y)
```

> [!NOTE]
>     This code will extract only the dollar amount from the string.
