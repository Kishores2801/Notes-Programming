- A string is a sequence of characters.
- A string literal uses quotes “Hello” or “Hello”.
- Fir string, + means “concatenate”.
- When a string contains numbers, it is still a string
- We can convert numbers in a string into a number using int()

``` Python
# Strings
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = " there!"
bob =  str1 + str2
print(bob)

str3 = "123"
# str4 = str3 +1

x = int(str3) + 2
print(x)

# Output:
# --------
# Hello there!
# 125
```

##### Looking inside strings
- We can get at any single character in a string using an index specified in Square brackets.
-  The index value must be an integer and start at Zero.
-  The index value can be an expression that is computed.

``` Python
# string
fruit = "Banana"

letter = fruit[1]
print(letter)

# Output:
# --------
# a
```

- you will get a “Python error” if you attempt to index beyond the end of string.
- so be careful when constructing index values and slices.

##### Strings have a length
The built-in function len gives us the length of a string.

``` Python
# string
fruit = "Banana"
print(len(fruit))

# Output:
# --------
# 6
```

A function is some stored code that we use. A function takes some input and produces an output.

##### Looping through Strings
Using a while statement and an iteration variable, and the len function, we can construct a loop to look at each of the letters in the string individually.

``` Python
## looping Through Strings
fruit = "Banana"

index = 0
while index <len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print(index, letter)
		index = index + 1


# Output:
# --------
# 0 B
# 1 a
# 2 n
# 3 a
# 4 n
# 5 a
```

- A definite loop using a for statement is much more elegant.
- The Iteration variable is completely taken care of by the for Loop.
``` Python
## looping Through Definite Strings
fruit = "Banana"

for letter in fruit:
    print(letter)

# Output:
# --------
# B
# a
# n
# a
# n
# a
```

##### Looping and Counting

This is a simple loop that loops through each letter in a string and counts the number of times in the loop encounters the “a” character.

```python
## Looping and counting
word = "Banana"
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == "a":
        count = count + 1
print(count)

# **Output**:
# --------
# 3
```

##### Looking deeper into “in”

- The **iteration variable** “iterates” through the sequence (ordered set).
- The **Block (body)** of code is executed once for each value in the sequence.
- The **iteration variable** moves through all of the values in the sequence.

```python
# Loop
for letter in "banana":
		print(letter)

# **Output**:
# --------
# b
# a
# n
# a
# n
# a
```

The iteration variable iterates through the string and the block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence.

##### Slicing String

- We can also look at any continuous section of a string using a **colon operator**.
- The second number is one beyond the end of the slice - “up to but not including”.
- If the second number is beyond the end of the string it stops at the end.

```python
## Slicing Strings
s = 'Monty Python'

print(s[0:4])
print(s[6:7])
print(s[6:20])

# **Output**:
# --------
# print(s[0:4]) => Mont
# print(s[6:7]) => P
# print(s[6:20]) => Python
```

if we leave off the first number or the last number of the slice. it is assumed to be the beginning or end of the string respectively.

```python
## Slicing Strings
s = 'Monty Python'

print(s[:2])
print(s[8:])
print(s[:])

# **Output**:
# --------
# print(s[:2]) => Mo
# print(s[8:]) => thon
# print(s[:]) => Monty Python
```

##### String Concatenation

When the “+” operators is applied to strings it means “concatenation”.

```python
# string concatenation 
a = 'Hello'
b = a + "There"
print (b)

c = a + " " + "There"
print (c)

# **Output**:
# --------
# HelloThere
# Hello There

```

##### String Library

- Python has number of string functions which are in the string Library.
- These functions are already built into every string- we invoke them by appending the function to the string variable.
- These functions do not modify the original string, instead they return a new string that has been altered.

###### Search and Replace

- The **replace()** function is like a “search and replace” operation a word processor.
- It replaces **all occurrence** of the **search string** with the **replacement string**.

```python
# search and replace
greet = "Hello Bob"
nstr = greet.replace("Bob", "Jane")
print(nstr)

# **Output**:
# --------
# Hello Jane

nstr = greet.replace("o", "X")
print(nstr)

# **Output**:
# --------
# HellX BXb
```

###### Stripping Whitespace

- Sometimes we want to take a string and remove whitespace at the beginning and/or end.
- **Istrip()** and **rstrip()** remove whitespace at the left or right.
- **strip()** removes both beginning and ending whitespace.

```python
# Stripping WhiteSpace
greet  = ' Hello Bob '

# stripping white space in both sides
print(greet.lstrip()) =>'Hello Bob '
# stripping white space in right side
print(greet.rstrip()) =>' Hello Bob'
# stripping white space in left side
print(greet.strip()) => 'Hello Bob'
```
