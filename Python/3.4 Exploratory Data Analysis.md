#### Descriptive Statistics

- Explore data before building complicated models.
- Calculate descriptive statistics for your data.
- Describe basic features of data.
- Giving short summaries about the sample and measures of the data.

### .describe()

- Summarize statistics using pandas `describe()` methods. This method will only work for numeric values.

```python
# Describing the data for only numeric values
df.describe()
```

- we can include categorical values in `describe(include=”all”)`.

```python
# Describing the data includes numeric and categorical values
df.describe(include="all")
```

### .value_counts()

Summarize the categorical data is by using the `.value_counts()` method.

```python
# summarize the categorical values
df.value_counts()
```

### Box plots

A boxplot is a graph that gives a visual indication of how a data set’s 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile, minimum, maximum and outlier values are spread out and compare to each other.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                   'col2': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']})

# Create a box plot of numeric features
sns.boxplot(
    x = "col1",
    y = "col2",
    showmeans=True,
    data=df
)

# Rotate x labels to prevent overlapping
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
	plt.show()
```

### Scatter plot

Scatter plots are the **graphs that present the relationship between two variables in a data-set**. It represents data points on a two-dimensional plane or on a Cartesian system. The independent variable or attribute is plotted on the X-axis, while the dependent variable is plotted on the Y-axis.

![[Scatter plot.png]]

```python
# Scatter plot
y = df["col1"] 
x = df["col2"]

# plot
plt.scatter(x,y)
# Title
plt.title("Scatterplot of col2 vs col1")
plt.xlabel("col2")
plt.ylabel("col1")
```

## Grouping Data

- Data grouping involves dividing a dataset into smaller groups based on shared characteristics in one or more columns.
- It enables you to analyze and summarize data within each group, revealing patterns and insights that might not be apparent when looking at the entire dataset.
- It's a fundamental technique in data analysis and is often used in conjunction with aggregation functions to calculate summary statistics for each group.

```python
grouped_data = dataframe.groupby('column_to_group_by')
```

**Key Steps:**

1. **Splitting:** The `groupby()` function divides the DataFrame into groups based on the values in the specified column(s).
2. **Applying a function:** You can apply functions to each group, such as aggregation functions (sum, mean, count, etc.) or custom functions.
3. **Combining results:** The results of the applied functions are then combined into a new DataFrame or Series.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {'Department': ['Sales', 'Sales', 'Marketing', 'Marketing', 'Sales'],
        'Employee': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Emily'],
        'Salary': [50000, 60000, 45000, 55000, 65000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group by Department and calculate average salary
grouped_data = df.groupby('Department')['Salary'].mean()
print(grouped_data)
```

**Additional Features:**

- **Multiple columns for grouping:** `df.groupby(['column1', 'column2'])`
- **Custom aggregation functions:** `df.groupby('column').agg(custom_function)`
- **Filtering groups:** `grouped_data.filter(lambda x: len(x) > 2)`
- **Applying custom functions to groups:** `grouped_data.apply(custom_function)`

### Group by vs Pivot Table

**Here's a comprehensive explanation of Python's groupby and pivot_table methods for data aggregation:**

**1. Groupby:**

- **Purpose:** Divides a DataFrame into groups based on one or more columns, allowing you to apply aggregate functions to each group independently.
- **Syntax:**

```python
grouped_data = df.groupby('column1')['column2'].agg(aggregate_function)

```

- **Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Product': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C'], 'Sales': [10, 20, 15, 30, 25]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

grouped_sales = df.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum()  # Sum sales for each product
print(grouped_sales)

```

**2. Pivot_table:**

- **Purpose:** Creates a spreadsheet-like pivot table, reshaping the DataFrame to summarize data according to multiple grouping criteria.
- **Syntax:**

```python
pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(df, values='column_to_aggregate', index='row_grouping', columns='column_grouping', aggfunc=aggregate_function)

```

- **Example:**

```python
data = {'Product': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C'], 'Month': ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Jan', 'Mar', 'Feb'], 'Sales': [10, 20, 15, 30, 25]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Sales', index='Product', columns='Month', aggfunc=sum)
print(pivot_table)

```

**Key Differences:**

- **Structure:** Groupby returns a GroupBy object or a Series/DataFrame of aggregated results, while pivot_table creates a new DataFrame with a pivoted structure.
- **Flexibility:** Groupby offers more control over aggregation steps, while pivot_table provides a concise way to create multi-dimensional summaries.

**Best Practices:**

- Use groupby for simple groupings and aggregations.
- Use pivot_table for multi-dimensional summaries with a pivoted structure.
- Choose based on the desired output format and level of control needed.

### Pivotable Heatmap

**1. Import Necessary Libraries:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

```

**2. Prepare Your Data:**

- Load your data into a pandas DataFrame.
- Ensure it has appropriate columns for pivoting and values for visualization.

**3. Create the Pivot Table:**

```python
pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(data, values='value_column', index='index_column', columns='column_column')

```

- Replace placeholders with actual column names.

**4. Generate the Heatmap:**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Adjust figure size as needed
sns.heatmap(pivot_table, annot=True, fmt=".1f", cmap="coolwarm")  # Customize annotations and colormap
plt.xlabel("Column Labels")
plt.ylabel("Index Labels")
plt.title("Heatmap Pivot Table")
plt.show()

```

**Customization Options:**

- `annot=True` displays numerical values within cells.
- `fmt` formats numerical values (e.g., ".1f" for one decimal place).
- `cmap` sets the colormap for the heatmap (e.g., "coolwarm", "viridis", "Blues").

**Example with Image:**
![[Heatma[p.png]]

**Additional Tips:**

- Use `cbar=True` to add a colorbar for value interpretation.
- Explore different colormaps to suit your data and visual preferences.
- Adjust figure size and labels for clarity.
- Consider using interactive heatmap libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for web-based visualizations.

## Correlation

"Correlation" is a powerful statistical concept used to describe the relationship between two variables. It essentially quantifies how much two variables "move together" - whether they both increase or decrease together, or one increases as the other decreases. But correlation isn't simply about saying "yes" or "no" to a relationship, it also has different strengths and tells us different things.

**What it measures:**

- **Direction:** Whether two variables have a positive correlation (both increase/decrease together), a negative correlation (one increases as the other decreases), or no correlation (no consistent relationship).
- **Strength:** The degree to which the variables move together, reflected by a **correlation coefficient** ranging from -1.0 (perfectly negative) to +1.0 (perfectly positive), with 0 indicating no correlation.

### **Types of correlation:**

- **Linear:** The most common type, where the relationship between variables follows a straight line.
- **Non-linear:** When the relationship isn't straightforward and cannot be represented by a straight line.

**Things to remember:**

- **Correlation does not imply causation:** Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other. There could be a third factor influencing both.
- **Correlation coefficient strength needs interpretation:** A coefficient close to 1 or -1 doesn't automatically guarantee a strong relationship depending on the context and data size.
- **Different types of data require different correlation measures:** Pearson's correlation is common for continuous data, while Spearman's is used for ranked data.

**Examples of correlation in action:**

- Studying the relationship between study hours and exam scores (might show positive correlation).
- Analyzing the correlation between temperature and ice cream sales (likely negative).
- Investigating the link between housing prices and square footage (positive correlation expected).

Correlation is a versatile tool for understanding relationships and patterns in data. By interpreting it correctly, you can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions in various fields like science, finance, business, and many more.

I hope this explanation provides a clearer understanding of correlation! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or want to explore specific examples.

### **Understanding Correlation with regplot:**

- **regplot() is a function in the Seaborn library specifically designed to visualize correlations between two numerical variables.**
- It simultaneously creates a scatter plot of the data points and overlays a regression line, visually depicting the relationship's direction and strength.

**Key Features:**

- **Scatter Plot:** Displays individual data points, revealing their general distribution and potential patterns.
- **Regression Line:** Fits a line through the data that best represents the overall trend, indicating the average relationship between the variables.
- **Slope:** The steepness of the regression line indicates the strength of the correlation:
    - Steeper slopes (closer to vertical) suggest stronger correlations.
    - Flatter slopes (closer to horizontal) suggest weaker correlations.
- **Direction:** The line's direction indicates whether the correlation is positive or negative:
    - Positive: Line slopes upward (↗), indicating variables tend to increase together.
    - Negative: Line slopes downward (↘), indicating one variable increases as the other decreases.

**Example with Image:**

**Code Example:**

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create regplot
sns.regplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)
plt.title("Correlation Between Total Bill and Tip")
plt.show()

```

#### Interpreting Correlation:

- **Correlation coefficient (r):** A numerical value between -1 and 1 that quantifies the correlation strength:
    - Closer to -1: Strong negative correlation
    - Closer to 0: Weak or no correlation
    - Closer to 1: Strong positive correlation

**Remember:**

- Correlation does not imply causation. It only reveals a relationship, not a direct cause-and-effect.
- Consider potential confounding variables and explore further analysis for deeper insights.

**1. Import Necessary Libraries:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

**2. Load Your Data:**

- Read your data into a pandas Data Frame.

**3. Calculate Correlation Coefficients:**

- **Pearson's correlation coefficient:**

```python
correlation_matrix = df.corr()  # Calculate correlations for all numerical columns
print(correlation_matrix)

correlation_coefficient = np.corrcoef(df['column1'], df['column2'])[0, 1]  # Calculate for specific columns
print(correlation_coefficient)

```

- **Spearman's correlation coefficient:**

**Python**

```
from scipy.stats import spearmanr
correlation, p_value = spearmanr(df['column1'], df['column2'])
print(correlation)
```

**Interpreting Correlation Coefficients:**

- Values range from -1 to +1.
- Closer to -1: Strong **negative** correlation.
- Closer to 0: Weak or no correlation.
- Closer to +1: Strong **positive** correlation.

**Remember:**

- Correlation does not imply causation.
