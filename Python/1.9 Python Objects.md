- A program is made up of many cooperating objects.
- instead of being the whole program - each object is a little island within the program and cooperatively working with other objects.
- A program is made up of one or more objects working together - objects make use of each other capabilities.
#### Objects

- An objects is a bit of self-contained code and Data
- A key aspects of the object approach is to break the problem into smaller understandable parts (divide and conquer)
- Objects have boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed details
- We have been using objects all along: string, Object, Integer objects, List object etc.
#### Definitions

`class` - a Template - Dog
`method` or `message` - A defined capability of a class - bark()
`field` or `attribute` - A bit of data in a class - length
`objects` or `instance` - A particular instance of class - Lessie
#### Objects: A Sample Class
The given code defines a class called `PartyAnimal` and creates an instance of that class. Let's break down the code step by step:

```python
class PartyAnimal:
    x = 0
    def party(self):
        self.x = self.x + 2
        print(self.x)
```

In this section, a class named `PartyAnimal` is defined. It has a class variable `x` initialized to 0 and a method called `party`. The `party` method takes a parameter `self`, which is a reference to the instance of the class.

Inside the `party` method, `self.x` is incremented by 2, and the updated value of `self.x` is printed.

```python
an = PartyAnimal()
an.party()
an.party()

```

In this section, an instance of the `PartyAnimal` class is created and assigned to the variable `an`. The parentheses `()` after `PartyAnimal` indicate that we are creating an instance of the class.

Then, the `party` method is called on the `an` instance using dot notation (`an.party()`). This results in the following output:

```python
2
```

The value of `self.x` starts at 0, then it is incremented by 2 in the first call to `an.party()`, resulting in 2.

The `party` method is called again on the `an` instance (`an.party()`), which further increments `self.x` by 2. The output is now:

```python
4
```

The value of `self.x` has been incremented again to 4.

In summary, the code defines a class `PartyAnimal` with a class variable and a method. It then creates an instance of that class and calls the `party` method on that instance twice, resulting in the increment of the class variable `x` and printing its updated value.
#### Ways to find the capabilities

- The `dir()` commands this capabilities.
- The one with “__” are used by Python.
- The rest are real operations that the objects can perform.
- It is like type() - it tells us something “about” the variables
#### Object Lifecycle
- Objects are created, used and discarded.
- We have special blocks of code (methods) that get called
    - at the moment of creation (Constructor)
    - at the moment of destruction (destructor)
- Constructors are used a lot and destructor are not so.
#### Constructor
- The Primary purpose of the Constructor is to set up some instances variables to have the proper initial values when the object is created.

```python
class partyAnimal:
    x = 0

    def __init__(self):
        print("I am Constructed")
    

    def party(self):
        self.x = self.x + 1
        print('so far ' , self.x)
    
    def __del__(self):
        print("I am Destructed", self.x)

an = partyAnimal()
an.party()
an.party()
an =42
print('an contains', an)
	
```

Constructors can have additional parameter, These can be used to set up instance variables for the particular instance of the class (i.e., for the particular object)

#### Object : Inheritance
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a base or parent class). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical class structuring.
##### Basic Concepts of Inheritance
- `Base Class (Parent Class)`: The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.
- `Derived Class (Child Class)`: The class that inherits properties and methods from another class.

#### Types of Inheritance
- **Single Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from a single base class.
``` Python
# Base class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

# Derived class
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

# Creating instances of derived classes
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!
```
- **Multiple Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
``` Python
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        return "Flying"

class Swimmer:
    def swim(self):
        return "Swimming"

class Duck(Bird, Swimmer):
    pass

duck = Duck()
print(duck.fly())   # Output: Flying
print(duck.swim())  # Output: Swimming
```
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from another derived class, creating a chain of inheritance.
``` Python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(dog.speak())        # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(dog.breed)          # Output: Golden Retriever
```
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
- **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.



#### Using the `super()` Function
The `super()` function allows you to call methods of the base class from the derived class, making it useful for extending or modifying inherited methods.

``` Python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(dog.speak())        # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(dog.breed)          # Output: Golden Retriever
```
##### Method Overriding
Derived classes can override methods from the base class to provide specific implementations.

``` Python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

circle = Circle(5)
rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)

print(circle.area())      # Output: 78.5
print(rectangle.area())   # Output: 24
```
#### Inheritance Hierarchy
Here is an example demonstrating multilevel and hierarchical inheritance.
``` Python
# Base class
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def info(self):
        return f"Brand: {self.brand}"

# Derived class
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        super().__init__(brand)
        self.model = model

    def info(self):
        return f"Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}"

# Another derived class
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, battery_capacity):
        super().__init__(brand, model)
        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity

    def info(self):
        return f"Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}, Battery Capacity: {self.battery_capacity} kWh"

# Creating instances
vehicle = Vehicle("Generic")
car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
electric_car = ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model S", 100)

print(vehicle.info())       # Output: Brand: Generic
print(car.info())           # Output: Brand: Toyota, Model: Corolla
print(electric_car.info())  # Output: Brand: Tesla, Model: Model S, Battery Capacity: 100 kWh
```

#### Summary
- **Inheritance** allows a derived class to inherit properties and methods from a base class.
- **Single inheritance** involves one base class and one derived class.
- **Multiple inheritance** allows a derived class to inherit from multiple base classes.
- The `super()` function is used to call methods of the base class from the derived class.
- **Method overriding** allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.
- **Inheritance hierarchies** can be created by combining different types of inheritance.
